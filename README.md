# Firebase_Train

In this app user can add trains and destinations to table using real time. The data is saved using firebase and the time updates automatically with MomentJs. User will add train name, destination, frequency, and first train arrival time. With moment and javascript the next arrival is calculated and the table will show how many minutes away each train is.
